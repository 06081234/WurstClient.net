        Navigator is much faster than ClickGUI, both FPS-wise and productivity-wise. Some people spend over 45s looking through the ClickGUI searching for a certain mod, but Navigator's integrated search bar can do that for you in a matter of milliseconds.

        Do you want to know what BookHack does or how ServerFinder works? No you can find out! Every feature in Wurst can have a tutorial button on its Navigator page, making it easier than ever to get started with features that you're not familar with.

        Mods, Commands and Special Features - Now they're all in one place. And instead of just having a small toggle button, every feature has its own page containing its description, settings, keybinds, and more.
