So you want to contribute to Wurst, eh?

Well you've come to the right place! The following step-by-step tutorial will teach you exactly how to do that.

**By the way, thank you for taking the time to contribute!** Your contributions massively speed up the development of Wurst and thereby help us to make it a better client for everyone.

## Requirements
In terms of experience, you will need a bit of **knowledge about Java**, as Wurst is entirely written in Java just like Minecraft is.

However, you don't have to be a complete expert at it. It's only important that you can make something that works, not that it looks particularly fancy.

So if you only have a little bit of experience and you're not sure if it's enough or not, just go ahead and try to contribute. I think in most cases it will be enough.

The requirements also include that you know the **basics of Git**, which is the version control system that we use for the Wurst-Client project. But don't be afraid if you don't know anything Git yet, because it's a pretty easy thing to learn.

GitHub made a beginner-friendly Git tutorial at <a href="http://try.github.io/" target="_blank">try.github.io</a> that can teach you most of the things you'll need in only about 15 minutes.
