So you want to contribute to Wurst, eh?

Well you've come to the right place! The following step-by-step tutorial will teach you exactly how to do that.

*By the way, thank you for taking the time to contribute!* Your contributions massively speed up the development of Wurst and thereby help us to make it a better client for everyone.

## Requirements
In terms of experience, you will need a bit of **knowledge about Java**, as Wurst is entirely written in Java just like Minecraft is.

However, you don't have to be a complete expert at it. It's only important that you can make something that works, not that it looks particularly fancy.

So if you only have a little bit of experience and you're not sure if it's enough or not, just go ahead and try to contribute. I think in most cases it will be enough.

The requirements also include that you know the **basics of Git**, which is the version control system that we use for the Wurst-Client project. But don't be afraid if you don't know anything Git yet, because it's a pretty easy thing to learn.

GitHub made a beginner-friendly Git tutorial at <a href="http://try.github.io/" target="_blank">try.github.io</a> that can teach you most of the things you'll need in only about 15 minutes.

And while you're at it, [make a **GitHub account**](https://github.com/) if you don't have one yet. You'll need that later so that you can fork the Wurst-Client repository, make Pull Requests, etc.

In terms of software, you should be using **Eclipse LUNA** as your IDE and **Windows 10** as your operating system. If you use a different software or a different operating system, you will likely need to do some things differently and you might run into issues that this tutorial can't help you with.

## 1. Signing the CLA
The **Contributor License Agreement** (CLA) is basically the terms and conditions for contributing to Wurst. You have to accept them in order to contribute something.

First, make sure that you're logged in to your GitHub account. Then go to [CLA-Assistant.io/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client](https://cla-assistant.io/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client), read the agreement and sign it by clicking the big blue button at the bottom.
