## Description
Adds a Player or all players on a server to your alt list.

Alts are "alternative" player names, that you can use on other servers. There is a difference between cracked Alts,
which you can only use on cracked Servers and premium Alts, which you can use everywhere. 
Use the Alt-Manager to manage them more specific.

## Syntax
`.addalt [player]` adds the entered player to your alt list.
`.addalt all' adds all players on a server to your alt list.

## Example
`.addalt Notch` adds Notch to your alt list.
