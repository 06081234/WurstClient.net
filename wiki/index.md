The Wurst Client is a Minecraft hacked client made by Alexander01998. It contains a large variety of cheats that allow you to do many things that you couldn't do in vanilla Minecraft. The main purpose of Wurst is to make Griefing easier, but it also has some features that are useful for other things, such as cheating in minigames. Since January 25 2015, Wurst is an open source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client).
