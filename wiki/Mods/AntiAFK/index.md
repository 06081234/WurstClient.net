## Overview
AntiAFK is a mod that makes you randomly walk around in a 3x3 area.

## Usage
AntiAFK can be used to hide from AFK (away from keyboard) detectors.

## Bypass
AntiAFK bypasses most AFK detector plugins, including some of the more modern ones that cannot be tricked by simply jumping every so often.

It has no problems bypassing NoCheat+ and other AntiCheat plugins, as those plugins do not attempt to block it.
