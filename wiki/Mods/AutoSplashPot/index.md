## Text Tutorial
As the name suggests, most of the things that AutoSplashPot does are automatic. As long as it is enabled, it will take care of throwing the health potions for you.

There is a "Health" slider on the Navigator page of AutoSplashPot. This slider configures the minimum health were it will stop throwing potions.

For example, if this slider is set to 20, it will throw a health potion whenever your health is at 19 or less. So it will always make sure that your health is at least the value on the slider.

There are no known issues with NoCheat+ or other AntiCheat plugins. AutoSplashPot should always bypass, even with YesCheat+ disabled.
