    Griefing a house and then placing signs on the remains to advertise the Wurst Client.

    It is unlikely that this advertisement will actually have any noticeable effect, as it was done on a private server, but it was still a lot of fun to do.

## Overview
AutoSign is a mod that automatically writes a certain text on every sign you place. The text that you manually write on the first sign that you place after activating AutoSign determines the text that will be automatically written on every sign that you place afterwards.

It will continue writing that text on all signs that you place until you turn it off. That also means that you need to turn AutoSign off and then turn it back on in order to change the text.

## Usage
Trajectories can be used to aim more precisely without having to use BowAimbot. Another advantage over BowAimbot is that Trajectories works with more things than just arrows.

AutoSign can be used for griefing by placing loads of signs all over a building in order to uglify it. This is especially effective when writing curse words on the signs.

It can also be used for spamming or advertising by writing the URL of a website, the IP of a server or whatever you want to advertise on a sign and then placing as many signs as possible, preferably in areas where the signs are visible to many people. Fun fact: The domain name "wurst-client.tk" was chosen for the Wurst Client website instead of "wurst-imperium.tk/Wurst-client" because it fits better on a sign.

Lastly, AutoSign can be used to cause lag on a server by placing so many signs in one place that everyone who gets too close to the signs experiences FPS lag. This strategy is especially effective on large plot servers. In an experiment done by Alexander01998 and gruenwald32, they were able to reduce people's frame rate to 4 FPS on a 750 slot server.

## Tips
- If you just want to place signs quickly without any special text on them, just place an empty sign right after activating AutoSign.
