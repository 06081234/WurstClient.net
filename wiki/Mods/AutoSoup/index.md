## Text Tutorial
As the name suggests, most of the things that AutoSoup does are automatic. As long as it is enabled, it will take care of eating the soup for you.

There is a "Health" slider on the Navigator page of AutoSoup. This slider configures the minimum health were it will stop eating soup.

For example, if this slider is set to 20, it will eat soup whenever your health is at 19 or less. So it will always make sure that your health is at least the value on the slider.

There are no known issues with NoCheat+ or other AntiCheat plugins. AutoSoup should always bypass, even with YesCheat+ disabled.
