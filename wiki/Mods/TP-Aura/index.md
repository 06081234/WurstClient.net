## Overview
TP-Aura (also known as EnderAura) is a mod that automatically attacks the closest valid entity within your range while randomly teleporting you around it.

## Usage
TP-Aura can be used to get an unfair advantage in combat situations, similar to Killaura. The random teleportations make it especially useful in PVP because it gives the other player barely any chance of ever hitting you back.

## Bypass
TP-Aura bypasses Mineplex AntiCheat, but it is blocked by NoCheat+. That amount of teleportations is just too obvious to bypass NoCheat+.

Like any Killaura in Wurst, TP-Aura can bypass AntiAura plugins if Target is properly configured. That being said, servers that use AntiAura usually have it in combination with NoCheat+.

## Tips
- If you want to use TP-Aura regularly, you should make a keybind for it.
