## Text Tutorial
1. Download and install the latest <a href="http://java.com/download" target="_blank">Java 8</a>.

2. Get rid of your old Java 6 or Java 7 installation.

3. If you still can't launch, go to [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net) and download the latest Minecraft launcher.

## Troubleshooting
- Do not skip step 2. It is important.

- Can't find your old Java installation? It is usually located at `C:\Program Files\Java\jreX.X.X_XX`.

- Still can't find it? Look where you installed Java 8, it's usually right next to that.

- Use the `Minecraft.jar` launcher, not `Minecraft.dmg`.
