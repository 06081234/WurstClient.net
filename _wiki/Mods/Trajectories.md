## Overview
Trajectories is a mod that predicts the flight path of arrows, splash potions, eggs, snowballs and ender pearls. It draws a line showing you where they would fly if you were to shoot or throw them in the direction that you are currently looking at.

## Usage
Trajectories can be used to aim more precisely without having to use BowAimbot. Another advantage over BowAimbot is that Trajectories works with more things than just arrows.

## Bypass
Trajectories bypasses everything, as it is entirely client-side.

## Tips
- You can also use Trajectories to teleport more precisely with ender pearls.
