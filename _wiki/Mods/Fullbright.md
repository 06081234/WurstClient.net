## Overview
Fullbright is a mod that allows you to see in the dark by increasing the brightness setting beyond its normal maximum. This makes dark areas appear bright enough without making bright areas appear too bright.

## Usage
Fullbright can be used to walk around in dark areas without the need to place torches.

## Bypass
Fullbright bypasses everything, as it is entirely client-side.
