## Overview
FancyChat is a mod that replaces ASCII characters in sent chat messages with fancier unicode characters.

## Usage
FancyChat can be used to bypass curse word filters on some servers.

## Bypass
FancyChat bypasses NoCheat+ and other AntiCheat plugins, but is blocked by plugins that block unicode characters.
