    This picture technically has nothing to do with the ArenaBrawl hack, but it's a good joke on the topic.

## Overview
ArenaBrawl is a mod that makes the ArenaBrawl game on mc.hypixel.net a lot easier. This is a collection of mods that have been optimized for ArenaBrawl.

## Usage
Before you use it, make sure you adjust the ArenaBrawl level slider. For the Fireball skill you need level 40, for Snowball, you need 20, etc.

Using it is pretty simple: Join a 2v2 arena and turn it on. When the game starts, it will start helping you. It will show you where all players and totems are by rendering a red or green frame around them. One of them will have a box instead of a frame and an arrow on the scoreboard. You should always follow the player/totem that has this box, because it's the best target. Once you are close enough to an enemy player or an enemy totem, the Killaura will attack it. If it's a player, it will also attack it with your offensive skill. If there is a player and a totem in your range, it will always attack the totem first. Remember to use your healing skill when you are low on health and your other skills when you need them. That part is not automatic.

## Bypass
ArenaBrawl bypasses everything that Hypixel has to offer.
