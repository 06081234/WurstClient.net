## Changelog

- Added Minecraft 1.12.1 compatibility mode. (experimental) (MC 1.12 & 1.12 OF)

- Renamed `.binds clear` to `.binds remove`.

- Renamed `.binds clear-all` to `.binds remove-all`.

- `.binds add` will now add new keybinds instead of adding new commands to existing keybinds.

- Keybinds can now be set to either toggle hacks or run commands. (`.binds add r killaura` and `.binds add r .t killaura` are both valid.)

- Keybinds that don't start with a dot will now be interpreted as commands rather than chat messages. (`.binds add h Hello world.` is no longer valid, but `.binds add h .say Hello world.` is.)

- In addition to using `;` in keybinds to separate multiple hacks/commands, one can now also use `;;` to run a single command that contains `;`. (`.binds add h .say Hello;; world.` is now valid and will output `Hello; world.` when pressed.)

- Improved Keybind Manager performance.

- Keybinds are now saved in a different format, but older keybinds.json files will be updated automatically.

- Re-worded an error message in the installer that some users found difficult to understand.

- Removed `.binds set`.

## Update: Wurst 6.11.1

- Fixed MC 1.12.1 mode using the wrong protocol number. (MC 1.12 & 1.12 OF)
