title: Can you please add OptiFine to Wurst?
---
<span class="sub-leader text-light">No, we will never add OptiFine to Wurst.</span>

Here are the main reasons why we won't add OptiFine:

1. It's quite buggy, at least it was the last time I used it. For instance, it often causes a crash when opening the Options screen and it sometimes breaks your singleplayer worlds.

2. There is a lot of false hype around it. Many people think that it's some sort of magic solution to stop lag on crappy computers, but the only real solution is to upgrade your computer or to get a better one. Not to mention that OptiFine prevents many people from getting a better computer and thereby slows down technical progress altogether.

**But what about zoom?**

Wurst has its own zoom that is actually much better than the zoom in OptiFine.

Press `~` (or `^` if you're on a German keyboard) to activate it. You can also use the mouse wheel while holding that key to zoom further in or further out.

Beat that, OptiFine!

**But what about capes?**

Well, Wurst also has its own cape system. Wurst capes are very hard to get and not available for sale - and we want to keep it that way.

Also, we might get in trouble with the creator of OptiFine if we just added their cape system without adding the whole mod (doing that increases the load on their servers without giving them anything in return).

**But I still want OptiFine!!1**

Wurst isn't our only hacked client. We also have [Wolfram](https://www.wolfram-client.tk/), which does have OptiFine built into it.

So if you really can't get over it, just use that instead of Wurst.
