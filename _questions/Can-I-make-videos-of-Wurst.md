Yes, you can do that. Please read the [Wurst Client License](https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/) for details on what you can and cannot do with Wurst.

Also keep in mind that you cannot re-upload someone else's video or thumbnail without their permission except as permitted by Fair Use laws.

**What if I monetize my videos?**

No problem.

**What about videos on other platforms?**

Same thing.

**Do I have to credit you in the video description?**

You don't have to, but you can if you want to.

**Can I use the Wurst logo in my thumbnail?**

Yes, as long as you don't change it.
