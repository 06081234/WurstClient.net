title: Can I use Wurst's source code in my own hacked client?
category: Copyright

It depends.

Usage of the Wurst Client and its source code is subject to the terms of the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/). This license allows you to distribute modified versions of Wurst or new clients based on Wurst under certain conditions.

Most importantly, your client must also be open source and must use the same license as Wurst. *You cannot use any of Wurst's code in a closed source client.*

Definitely [read the full license](https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/) before using any of Wurst's code. You must follow all of its conditions.

**But do you actually care about all this?**

Absolutely! There have (unfortunately) been a number of cases where people attempted to use Wurst's code without following the terms of the license (most of them tried to use it in a closed source client, which is why we explicitly mentioned that part above). Most of these cases were resolved by taking down the infringing material.

**But Mojang owns Minecraft. That means they own Wurst and you can't do anything!**

Wrong. Just because Mojang owns Minecraft, that doesn't mean they own the mods, cheats, hacks, clients, tools, etc. that other people have made. In copyright law, such things are called "derivative works".

While Minecraft is copyrighted by Mojang, Wurst is copyrighted by Alexander01998 (that's why there are two copyright notices in the main menu).

**But Wurst violates Mojang's EULA! That means you can't do anything!**

Wrong. We are not distributing the Minecraft source code (that's why we have the patch), we are not selling any Minecraft related merchandise (we took it down when they added that part) and we are not selling capes either (Wurst capes can't be bought).

We believe that Wurst is entirely compliant with Mojang's EULA. However, as stated in the license, we are distributing Wurst without a warranty of noninfringement (or any other kind of warranty).

Should Wurst ever turn out to be violating any part of the EULA, *then of course our copyright doesn't suddenly disappear*. Even in that case, you still have to respect the license.

If you still don't get it, consider the following example:

Imagine that you have stolen a car. When the police shows up at your door, you tell them that you only stole the car because you believe that the owner has previously stolen it from someone else. What are they going to do with you, even if it turns out that the owner has indeed stolen the car from someone else?

The answer: They will put you in jail.

**But Wurst is open source, that means it doesn't have copyright!**

Wrong. Open source has nothing to do with removing the owner's copyright. What you are talking about is public domain software.
