title: Why can I not use cracked alts on premium servers?
---
Cracked alts are not real Minecraft accounts, they are just a username without a password. Premium alts are real Minecraft accounts that someone actually bought from Mojang - they have a valid username, password, email address, etc.

Cracked servers don't validate any of the accounts - they let anyone join the server, even if their password is wrong or the account doesn't actually exist. Premium servers do validate the accounts. They check every player that tries to join the server and only let them in if the account is valid.

And because cracked alts don't have a password and in many cases don't even exist, they immediately fail that check and are denied from any premium server that they try to join. They only work on cracked servers, where all authentication is disabled.

**But can't you just bypass that?**

No, and we wouldn't want to if we could. It would mean that anyone could play Minecraft without needing to buy the game, which would then result in Mojang going out of business and Minecraft going down.

**But you created that system, right?**

No, we only changed the message that appears when you get kicked for that reason. You would still get kicked when trying to do the same thing in vanilla Minecraft.

The vanilla message tells you to restart Minecraft, which isn't necessary if you're using Wurst. You can just use the Alt Manager and log in with a premium alt instead - no restart needed. That's why we changed the message.

**But how can I get a premium alt?**

A premium alt is simply a premium Minecraft account - you should already have one of those. Just add it to your alt list and log in.
