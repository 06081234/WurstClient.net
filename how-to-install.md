## Text Version
Before you can install Wurst, you will obviously need to download it.

To do that, go to [wurst-client.tk/download](https://www.wurst-client.tk/download/), select the Minecraft version and Wurst version that you want, then download that version and save it on your computer.

Once you have that file, the next step is to extract it.

If you're on Windows 10 then all you need to do is double-click on the ZIP file and then drag all of the contents out of it.

If you're not on Windows 10 then you can use a third-party tool such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.

Although all of these tools work a bit differently, most of them will either give you the option to open the ZIP file and drag stuff out of it, or they will give you some kind of "Extract" button whenever you right-click on a ZIP file.

Once you're done extracting that, open up Windows Explorer and type in `%appdata%`.

This will redirect you to a folder called `Roaming` which contains a bunch of other folders including `.minecraft`. Click on that and then go to `versions`.

Next, go back to where you extracted the file, take the folder that was inside of it and move that into `versions`.

Once you're done with that, start up the Minecraft launcher and create a new profile.

Under the `Use version` section, select the version that you have just installed and then save the profile.

If your new version doesn't show up for some reason, simply restart the launcher and it should appear.

Once you have that profile, your installation is complete.

From now on, whenever you select this profile and hit `Play` you will be launching Wurst instead of regular Minecraft.

And of course if you want to go back, simply select your other profile and launch that.
