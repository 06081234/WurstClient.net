## Overview

There is a website out there offering a fake version of Wurst 2.21.2 that steals your Minecraft account as soon as you use it. Even worse than that, this fake version has already been downloaded over 120,000 times.

We will not give you the name of that website (at least not directly) because we don't want to promote those scammers in any way, but we will make it clear enough so that you will recognize the website if you have ever seen it.

This is what the website looks like:

![scammer website](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/19105248/620c2c16-8ae1-11e6-8a29-250e2faedc57.jpg)

As you can see, Wurst is not the only client that is affected by this scam. They are distributing fake versions of three different clients:

- Wurst 2.21.2
- Huzuni 3.5
- Icarus b16

## Exposing The Scam

Nobody had noticed this fraud until a <a href="https://leakforums.net/thread-656704?page=1" target="_blank">thread on LeakForums</a> exposed that both their website and the clients they offer are secretly stealing people's Minecraft accounts.

Here is a quote from the thread:

> I got myself 2 [accounts] (I'll explain why 2 later) and put one of them in the checker with a long list of old and changed accounts. **A few days later I got my account logged into hypixel and they had used all the credits and gotten banned.** So I immediately went to [REDACTED] and saw that it was on there.
>
> BUT I also noticed they have clients to download, what if they do the same thing? So I downloaded 'Huzuni 3.5 VIP' and put the same alt list but a new account. I made sure I only logged in the account WITH the client and never used the account again. **Next week [...] I log in to see that I'm now also banned on Hypixel ðŸ˜¿.** So as usual I now go to [REDACTED] and go through my 5 accounts for free and what do you know. It's on there clear as day.
>
> **TL;DR: Don't use [REDACTED], they steal your accounts.**

(emphasis added, name of the website removed)

## How To Protect Yourself

First off, only download Wurst from its official website [Wurst-Client.tk](/) (or WiZARDHAX.com which links to Wurst-Client.tk)!

If you have ever downloaded Wurst (especially version 2.21.2) from any other website, then you may be affected by this scam.

In that case, you should immediately change your Minecraft password, delete your current Wurst installation and get a fresh copy of the [original version](/download/).

## Taking It Down

This is a clear case of copyright infringement and phishing.

It's copyright infringement because they are pretending that they made the Wurst Client and are distributing it without the source code, which is a violation to the Mozilla Public License, which is the only thing that would allow them to distribute Wurst at all. It's also phishing because, as said before, they are stealing people's accounts.

Taking down copyright infringing material usually follows a three-step process:

1. Contact the person who is responsible for the infringement and request that they remove the infringing material.

2. If they don't respond or refuse to remove the infringing material, send a DMCA takedown notice to their hosting provider.

3. If that doesn't help either, contact your lawyer.

Step 1 is meant as a fair chance, just in case they are nice people and are willing to resolve the issue. We have completed this step yesterday by sending them a polite and formal email, but as expected, they are not willing to resolve this issue.

Step 2 is basically the same fair chance for the hosting provider. Most hosting providers do not tolerate any copyright infringements or other illegal activities, so this step is usually very effective. The problem is that this person is apparently hosting their website all by themselves, meaning that the only thing we're left with is step 3.

Step 3 is a very expensive and time consuming process (which is why we are posting this warning), but if necessary, we are willing to go through this to protect our users.

We are hoping that this loss of time won't get in the way of the regular Wurst updates, but because we were able to resolve all previous cases of copyright infringement through either step 1 or step 2, we don't know exactly how much time and money this is going to cost us.
