Hey everyone, today we have the Wurst update 4.0 for Minecraft 1.10. I know you've been waiting for a while, but today it is finally here!

Now this update is a bit different than the previous ones. There won't be any pre-releases this time, so you won't have to wait any longer.

In fact, this is the fastest major update that we ever did so far. We managed to finish the entire thing in only one afternoon (about 8-9 hours)!

One thing to note about this update is that it is not using the ASM system that we announced in the [previous post](/news/2016-06-28-Sneak-Peek-Wurst-for-Minecraft-1-10/). It is going to take quite a while until that system becomes production ready and I don't want to let you wait that long.

The other reason why this is not just a pre-release is because I couldn't find any bugs in it. If you can find any, you know where that [bug tracker](/bugs/) is.
