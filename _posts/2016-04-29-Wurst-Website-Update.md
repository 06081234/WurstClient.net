This week, instead of a Wurst update, we have a Wurst website update. I've been working on this new design for a couple of weeks now and I am very pleased with the results.

The best part is that this new design not only looks better, but it also makes the site faster and easier to use. Watch the video for details about that.

Here are some links to the parts of the site that have changed:

- [Wurst News](/)

- [Wurst Wiki](/wiki/Main_Page/)

- [Downloads Page](/download/)
