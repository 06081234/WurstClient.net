## Changelog

+Friends will now be sorted alphabetically.

+MultiAura

+New InstantBunker

+X-Ray Block Manager

*The Wurst GUI will no longer overlap the F3 debug GUI.

*Killaura now uses packets to face entities.

*The slider for the Killaura YesCheat+ speed now changes the normal Killaura speed.

*YesCheat+ now limits the Killaura speed to 12 attacks per second and the Killaura and Nuker range to 4.25 blocks when it's enabled. For instance, if you set the speed to 20 and YesCheat+ is off, the speed will be 20. If you turn YesCheat+ on, the slider will still say 20, but the actual speed will be 12. Once you turn YesCheat+ off, the speed will be 20 again. If you set the speed to something lower than or equal to 12, it won't be affected at all.

*Smaller fixes and improvements.

-Removed AutoAdSign. That was a stupid mod.
