## Changelog

- :new: Killaura FOV slider. Also works for KillauraLegit, BowAimbot, Follow, Protect and ForcePush.

- :new: NoClip Mod: Allows you to freely move through blocks. A block (e.g. sand) must fall on your head to activate it.

- :new: Zoom. You can now zoom in by pressing the <kbd> \ </kbd>, <kbd>~</kbd> or <kbd>^</kbd> key (depends on your keyboard, watch video for details).

- :rocket: Minor performance improvements regarding mods that target entities (Killaura, etc.).

- :rocket: Wurst cape optimizations: Reduced the amount of requests sent to the Wurst cape server by grouping up to 100 requests together.
