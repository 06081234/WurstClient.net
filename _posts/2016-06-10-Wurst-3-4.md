## Changelog

- **Added [ExtraElytra](/wiki/Mods/ExtraElytra)** (community contribution by vovanre).  
This new mod makes it easier to fly with the Elytra that Mojang added in Minecraft 1.9. When using the "Easy fly" option, it also lets you control your speed using the <kbd>W</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd> keys and your altitude using the <kbd>SPACE</kbd> and <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> keys.

- **Improved the EventManager**, a behind-the-scenes code that handles pretty much everything that Wurst does. The new EventManager is capable of managing a lot more events than the old one at a much faster speed than the old one.

- **Added PacketOutputEvents** (again, background code stuff). They make life easier for developers and contributors.

- Fixed keybinds for ModeSettings with spaces not working.

- Fixed a crash with entity names.

- Fixed a crash with the `.xray` command.
