After about two weeks of coding, the new Wurst Client website is finally here! Just like the Wurst Client, this website is open source. You can find it's source code at [GitHub.com/Wurst-imperium/wurst-client.tk](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/wurst-client.tk).

For now, that's pretty much it, but a lot of awesome things are going to happen in the future. Make sure to [subscribe to the news](/news/feed.xml) so that you don't miss any of them.
